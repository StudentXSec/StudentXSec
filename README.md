# 👋 Hey, I’m StudentX  

🚀 Cybersecurity professional in the making, focused on **InfraSec + Offensive Security**.  
I’m building a hybrid path where I learn to both **defend infrastructure** and **think like an attacker**.  

---

## 🔐 Current Focus
- Studying for **CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)**  
- Preparing for **AZ-900** (Azure Fundamentals)  
- Building hands-on projects in **Active Directory, IAM (Okta/Entra ID), and Cloud Security**  
- Running **offensive security labs** (XSS, SSRF, IDOR, API exploitation)  

---

## 🛠️ Labs & Projects
I document my projects in a consulting-style format to show both **process** and **results**.  

- 🔧 [Vulnerability Management Project](#) *(coming soon)*  
- 🖥️ [Help Desk Linux Ticket Simulation](#) *(coming soon)*  
- 🌐 [Web Security Labs (XSS, SSRF, IDOR)](#) *(coming soon)*

## 🎯 Goals
- **Short-Term:** Land a role in Helpdesk / SysAdmin / IAM Support  
- **Mid-Term:** Grow into InfraSec and Cloud Security roles  
- **Long-Term:** Operate as a **Dangerous Security Architect** with hybrid InfraSec + Offensive expertise
