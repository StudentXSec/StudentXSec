🚀 Hands-on Cybersecurity Portfolio – QuickLabs and Consultant-Style Projects documenting my journey from Helpdesk to Security Architect.

# StudentXSec – Cybersecurity Portfolio

## About This Portfolio
This repository showcases my practical cybersecurity journey through **QuickLabs** (bite-sized exercises like Linux administration and PortSwigger web labs) and **Projects** (consultant-style deliverables such as Vulnerability Management, Active Directory Enumeration, and IAM configurations).  

Each lab includes **objectives, steps, screenshots, and key takeaways**, while larger projects are documented with **professional reports** mapped to real-world compliance frameworks (OWASP, NIST).  

I’m actively expanding this portfolio to strengthen my fundamentals and demonstrate the applied skills I bring to **helpdesk, sysadmin, and security analyst roles**, with a long-term focus on **offensive security and security architecture**.

# 👋 Hey, I’m StudentX
🚀 Cybersecurity professional in the making, focused on **InfraSec + Offensive Security**.  
I’m building a hybrid path where I learn to both **defend infrastructure** and **think like an attacker**.
